# Timelines

## Week1:

Read paper and learnt associated knowledge

* [Linear Transformations and the k-Means Clustering Algorithm Applications to Clustering Curves](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Functional-data-analysis-draft/blob/master/Wrapup0418/papers/Linear%20Transformations%20and%20the%20k-Means%20Clustering%20Algorithm%20Applications%20to%20Clustering%20Curves.pdf)
* [Stratified Psychiatry via Convexity-Based Clustering with Applications Towards Moderator Analysis](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Functional-data-analysis-draft/blob/master/Wrapup0418/papers/Stratified%20Psychiatry%20via%20Convexity-Based%20Clustering%20with%20Applications%20Towards%20Moderator%20Analysis.pdf)
* [pre presentation](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Functional-data-analysis-draft/blob/master/Wrapup0418/papers/talkFDNY.pdf)

And asked questions 
* [File](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Functional-data-analysis-draft/blob/master/Wrapup0418/results/some%20understandings%20and%20questions-Kate-2019-01-24.pdf)
* [Codes for this file 1](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Functional-data-analysis-draft/blob/master/Wrapup0418/codes/some%20understandings%20and%20questions-Kate-2019-01-24.Rmd)
* [Codes for this file 2](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Functional-data-analysis-draft/blob/master/Wrapup0418/codes/simulation%20and%20draw%20figure4%200124.R)


# Week2:

Aim: 

* Try to analyze the real data. Choose 2 or more baseline covariates and do k-means and see whether we could get a good VI.

The data used: 

* *longFormat_score17*

The codes: 

* [codes files](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Functional-data-analysis-draft/tree/master/Wrapup0418/codes/VI)

The results:

* [results files](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Functional-data-analysis-draft/tree/master/Wrapup0418/results/VI)

By simply choose variables without transforamtinos, the results are not very satified.
